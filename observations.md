I built a circuit that had a 12V source and a 100 Ohm resistor that led into a green LED and then led into ground. The second circuit was exactly the same besides the fact
its voltage source was 2V instead of 12V. Voltage is the amount of force available it can use and current is the amount of force actaully being used to move stuff throughout
the system. They interact with each other because the higher the voltage source the higher the current could be.
